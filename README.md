Everybody loves to have a sense of ownership. With this logic, wouldn't it be more engaging if we can monitor the real-time progress of the tree(s) we sponsor to plant, instead of receiving a simple "Thank You" message or a piece of static certificate?

This project aims to add an extended feature to the existing RBC reward program to include a new tree-planting program called "My Forest." The scope of the project focuses on the tree monitoring system, once RBC card holders use their points to redeem for the My Forest tree planting option. The scope of the project does not include the logistics behind planting a tree. Through research we have concluded that the best option is to plant trees nationally, and the cost and process include: one tree sapling to be grown, one tree to be planted, the average cost per tree with transport and material costs, the ongoing maintenance, and in order to ensure fair trade the cost per tree is a minimum of $5. We assume information we need to build this app (i.e. the geolocation of the tree) is collected and available to us. The trees will be planted in British Columbia, the Prairies, Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces (inclu. NL).

We have included incentives to encourage people to use their points for this reward over others.
